/*
 * Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns the node at
 * the beginning of the loop.
 * DEFINITION
 * Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer points
 * to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input: A - > B - > C - > D - > E - > C [the same C as earlier]
 * Output: C

         * ------ BEFORE LOOP size = 2
         * A -> B -> C -> [D!] -> E -> F -> [D]      | collision point 0 away from beginning of loop D
         * ----------- BEFORE LOOP size = 3
         * A -> B -> C -> D -> [E] -> F -> G! -> [E] | collision point 1 away from beginning of loop E
         * ---------------- BEFORE LOOP size = 4
         * 
         * We can then essentially deduce BEFORE_LOOP % LOOP_SIZE = how far the collision away is from the beginning.
         * Since we know there must be a loop, BEFORE LOOP must be a multiple of how far away the collision point is from the beginning of the loop (or the collision point would be in a different spot).
         * Then we can simply run a pointer from BEFORE LOOP and then continue a pointer from collision point, and the place they collide is the beginning of the loop.
         * 
         * More formally: when the slower pointer takes k steps, the faster pointer will have taken 2k steps. Therefore, the collision would have happened at 2k - k (or k steps).
         * When the slower pointer is 0 steps into the loop, the faster pointer will be k % LOOP_SIZE (K from now on) steps into the loop.
         * The slower pointer is thus LOOP_SIZE - K distance from the faster pointer.
         * Since both pointers are now in a circle, the faster pointer will approach the slower pointer at a rate of 1 node per step.
         * Since K is just k % LOOP_SIZE, another pointer sent from the beginning of the list will collide with a pointer resumed from the start of the list, as both are K away from the beginning of the list.
